This is small responsive project that I made using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.
The purpose of this application is to show case the latest Arsenal Kits for the season 22/23.

How to use it:

1. When the page loads you will see the red arsenal kit in front of you.
2. Press any of the colors at the bottom, to switch the kit and you will see a transition where the old kit switches with the new one
